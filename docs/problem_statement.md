# Book Exchange Platform - Problem Statement

## Problem
Students often discard or store unused textbooks after completing courses, while other students need these same books. This creates waste and unnecessary expenses.

A platform where students can:
- List books they no longer need
- Search for books they require
- Exchange books with other students
- Reduce waste and save money

## Goals
1. Create a simple web interface for book listings
2. Implement user authentication
3. Enable search functionality
4. Facilitate communication between students
